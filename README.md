# React D3 Pie

## About

This is an example of using React with D3v4. It was based on a post [here](https://swizec.com/blog/how-to-make-a-piechart-using-react-and-d3/swizec/6785).

I was having trouble getting it to work, so after I had it working, I put the working code on github here. The original code is from [Swizec] (https://github.com/swizec), but I didn't see it in github.

This example was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app).

To create the pie chart, only 2 D3 libraries were pulled in, D3-scale, and D3-shape.
